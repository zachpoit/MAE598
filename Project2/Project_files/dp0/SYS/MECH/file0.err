/COM,ANSYS RELEASE 2022 R2           BUILD 22.2      UP20220516       22:54:57

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.125   TIME= 22:54:57
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.125   TIME= 22:54:57
 MPC184 elements are being used in the current analysis and the          
 NLGEOM,ON command has not been used.  Thus, only linearized behavior    
 will be considered.  If finite rotation and large deflection effects    
 are to be considered, please use the NLGEOM,ON command.                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.156   TIME= 22:54:57
 Material number 14 (used by element 10715) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.625   TIME= 22:54:58
 Maximum friction coefficient 0.22 is defined in the model.  Switch to   
 the unsymmetric solver (NROP,UNSYM) instead if convergence difficulty   
 is encountered.                                                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.109   TIME= 22:54:58
 For element 10715 the element connectivity is 0 and 13363.  The node    
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.109   TIME= 22:54:58
 The sparse solver must be used if any current technology elements with  
 u-P formulation or MPC184 elements using Lagrangian multiplier          
 entangle with other contraint equtions.  The equation solver option     
 has been switched to the sparse solver.                                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.234   TIME= 22:54:58
 For element 10715 the element connectivity is 0 and 13363.  The node    
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.453   TIME= 22:54:59
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
